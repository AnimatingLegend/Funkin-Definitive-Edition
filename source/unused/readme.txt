These are basically misc files in the game. 
`NGio.hx` is a Newgrounds API, to detect whether you won an achievement or not for the game & `GitarooPause.hx` is a mini easter egg.

they're both useless peices of media in the game and they are left unused, the only reason why their still in the src code is so people can dick around with it if they would like to :]
